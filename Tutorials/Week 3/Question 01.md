The Gram-Schmidt procedure is a systematic method for taking a set of linearly independent vectors and creating a new set of **orthonormal** vectors that span the same vector space. In essence, it "straightens out" a basis into a set of perpendicular, unit-length vectors.

### **Q1. What is the Gramâ€“Schmidt procedure? Write down the procedure.**

To perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure, you start with a set of linearly independent vectors $\{|v_1\rangle, |v_2\rangle, \dots, |v_n\rangle\}$. The goal is to produce an **orthonormal** set $\{|e_1\rangle, |e_2\rangle, \dots, |e_n\rangle\}$, where the vectors are mutually orthogonal ($\langle e_i | e_j \rangle = 0$ for $i \neq j$) and normalized ($\langle e_i | e_i \rangle = 1$).

## **Solution 1: The Standard (Modified) Gram-Schmidt Procedure**
This is the most commonly used and numerically stable version. It works by iteratively creating orthogonal vectors and normalizing them at each step.



The procedure constructs an intermediate set of orthogonal vectors $\{|w_k\rangle\}$ and then normalizes them.

**1. Step 1:**
Take the first vector, $|v_1\rangle$, and define it as the first orthogonal vector, $|w_1\rangle$. Then, normalize it to get the first orthonormal vector, $|e_1\rangle$.

$$|w_1\rangle = |v_1\rangle$$

$$|e_1\rangle = \frac{|w_1\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle w_1 | w_1 \rangle}}$$

**2. Step 2:**
Take the second vector, $|v_2\rangle$, and make it orthogonal to the first orthonormal vector, $|e_1\rangle$, by subtracting its projection onto $|e_1\rangle$.

$$|w_2\rangle = |v_2\rangle - \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle |e_1\rangle$$

Then, normalize the resulting vector $|w_2\rangle$.

$$|e_2\rangle = \frac{|w_2\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle w_2 | w_2 \rangle}}$$

**3. General Step (k):**
For each subsequent vector $|v_k\rangle$, subtract its projections onto **all** the previously computed orthonormal vectors $\{|e_1\rangle, \dots, |e_{k-1}\rangle\}$.

$$|w_k\rangle = |v_k\rangle - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \langle e_j | v_k \rangle |e_j\rangle$$

Then, normalize the resulting orthogonal vector $|w_k\rangle$.

$$|e_k\rangle = \frac{|w_k\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle w_k | w_k \rangle}}$$

Repeating this process for all vectors results in the desired orthonormal set $\{|e_1\rangle, |e_2\rangle, \dots, |e_n\rangle\}$. ðŸŽ¯

## **Solution 2: The Classical Gram-Schmidt Procedure**
This is an alternative formulation where all vectors are made orthogonal first, and the normalization is performed as a final step for all vectors.

**1. Step 1:**
The first orthogonal vector is simply the first vector from the original set.

$$|w_1\rangle = |v_1\rangle$$

**2. General Step (k):**
For each subsequent vector $|v_k\rangle$, subtract its projections onto all the previously computed **orthogonal** vectors $\{|w_1\rangle, \dots, |w_{k-1}\rangle\}$. Note that the projection formula is slightly different because the $|w_j\rangle$ vectors are not yet normalized.

$$|w_k\rangle = |v_k\rangle - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \frac{\langle w_j | v_k \rangle}{\langle w_j | w_j \rangle} |w_j\rangle$$

**3. Final Step:**
After generating the complete set of orthogonal vectors $\{|w_1\rangle, \dots, |w_n\rangle\}$, normalize each one to get the final orthonormal set.

$$|e_k\rangle = \frac{|w_k\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle w_k | w_k \rangle}} \quad \text{for all } k=1, \dots, n$$

While both methods are mathematically equivalent, the first solution (Modified Gram-Schmidt) is generally preferred in practice due to its superior numerical stability.






Of course. The operation in Step 2 is the core of the Gram-Schmidt procedure. Subtracting the projection removes the component of $|v_2\rangle$ that is parallel to $|e_1\rangle$, leaving only the part that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to it.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why this works, explained both geometrically and algebraically.

### **Detailed Explanation of Step 2**

In Step 2, we construct a new vector, $|w_2\rangle$, from the original vector $|v_2\rangle$ using the formula:

$$|w_2\rangle = |v_2\rangle - \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle |e_1\rangle$$

The goal is to show that this new vector $|w_2\rangle$ (and its normalized version $|e_2\rangle$) is **orthogonal** to $|e_1\rangle$.

## **1. The Geometric Intuition**

Let's visualize what the components of the formula mean.
* **$|v_2\rangle$**: This is our original vector, which is generally not orthogonal to $|e_1\rangle$.
* **$|e_1\rangle$**: This is a **unit vector** that defines a direction (or an axis).
* **$\text{proj}_{e_1}(|v_2\rangle) \equiv \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle |e_1\rangle$**: This term is the **orthogonal projection** of the vector $|v_2\rangle$ onto the line defined by $|e_1\rangle$. You can think of this as the "shadow" that $|v_2\rangle$ casts on the $|e_1\rangle$ axis. This projection represents the entire component of $|v_2\rangle$ that is parallel to $|e_1\rangle$.



Any vector, including $|v_2\rangle$, can be thought of as a sum of two parts: a component parallel to $|e_1\rangle$ and a component perpendicular to $|e_1\rangle$.
$$|v_2\rangle = |v_{2, \parallel}\rangle + |v_{2, \perp}\rangle$$The parallel component, $|v_{2, \parallel}\rangle$, is exactly what the projection gives us. So, the Gram-Schmidt formula becomes:$$|w_2\rangle = |v_2\rangle - |v_{2, \parallel}\rangle$$When we subtract the parallel component from the original vector, what remains is purely the perpendicular component:$$|w_2\rangle = |v_{2, \perp}\rangle$$
By definition, this resulting vector $|w_2\rangle$ must be orthogonal to $|e_1\rangle$.

## **2. The Algebraic Proof**

We can prove this rigorously. For two vectors to be orthogonal, their inner product must be zero. So, we need to show that $\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = 0$.

Let's compute the inner product:
$$\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = \left\langle e_1 \middle| \left( |v_2\rangle - \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle |e_1\rangle \right) \right\rangle$$

Using the linearity of the inner product, we can distribute $\langle e_1 |$ across the terms in the parentheses:
$$\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle - \left\langle e_1 \middle| \left( \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle |e_1\rangle \right) \right\rangle$$

In the second term, the quantity $\langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle$ is just a complex number (a scalar). We can pull scalars out of an inner product:
$$\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle - \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle \langle e_1 | e_1 \rangle$$

From Step 1 of the procedure, we know that $|e_1\rangle$ is a normalized vector, which means its inner product with itself is 1.
$$\langle e_1 | e_1 \rangle = 1$$Substituting this in gives:$$\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle - \langle e_1 | v_2 \rangle \cdot 1$$
$$\langle e_1 | w_2 \rangle = 0$$
Since their inner product is zero, the vector $|w_2\rangle$ is orthogonal to $|e_1\rangle$. âœ…

Finally, the vector $|e_2\rangle$ is just the normalized version of $|w_2\rangle$:
$$|e_2\rangle = \frac{|w_2\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle w_2 | w_2 \rangle}}$$
Normalization only changes a vector's length, not its direction. Therefore, since $|w_2\rangle$ is orthogonal to $|e_1\rangle$, $|e_2\rangle$ is also orthogonal to $|e_1\rangle$.
