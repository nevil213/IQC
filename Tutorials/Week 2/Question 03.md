The matrix representation of the operator $|v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$ in the orthonormal basis $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ is a matrix with a single non-zero entry: a '1' located at the intersection of the $j$-th row and the $k$-th column.

### **Q3. Suppose $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space $V$. What is the matrix representation for the operator $|v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$, with respect to the $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ basis?**

The operator in question, $A = |v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$, is an **outer product**. To find its matrix representation, $M$, in the given basis, we need to compute each of its elements, $M_{il}$.

### **The Derivation**

**1. The Formula for Matrix Elements**
The element in the $i$-th row and $l$-th column of the matrix representation of any operator $A$ is found by "sandwiching" the operator between the corresponding basis vectors:

$$M_{il} = \langle v_i | A | v_l \rangle$$

**2. Substituting the Operator**
We substitute our specific operator, $A = |v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$, into this formula:

$$M_{il} = \langle v_i | \left( |v_j\rangle\langle v_k| \right) | v_l \rangle$$

**3. Using Associativity**
We can regroup the terms, which is mathematically equivalent to first having the bra $\langle v_k|$ act on the ket $|v_l\rangle$, and then having the ket $|v_j\rangle$ acted on by the bra $\langle v_i|$:

$$M_{il} = \left( \langle v_i | v_j \rangle \right) \left( \langle v_k | v_l \rangle \right)$$

**4. Applying Orthonormality**
The problem states that $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ is an **orthonormal basis**. This means the inner product of any two basis vectors is given by the **Kronecker delta**, $\delta_{ab}$, which is 1 if $a=b$ and 0 if $a \neq b$.

Applying this to our two inner products:
* $\langle v_i | v_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
* $\langle v_k | v_l \rangle = \delta_{kl}$

This gives the final expression for our matrix element:

$$M_{il} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl}$$

**5. Interpreting the Result**
This simple expression tells us everything about the matrix $M$:
* The term $\delta_{ij}$ means the matrix element is zero unless the row index, $i$, is equal to the specific index $j$ from the operator's definition.
* The term $\delta_{kl}$ means the matrix element is zero unless the column index, $l$, is equal to the specific index $k$.

For a matrix element to be non-zero, both conditions must be true simultaneously: $i=j$ and $l=k$. In this case, the element is $M_{jk} = \delta_{jj}\delta_{kk} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$.

Therefore, the matrix representation of $|v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$ is a matrix of all zeros, with a single **1** in the $j$-th row and $k$-th column. ðŸ’¡

### **Example**

Let's consider the standard two-dimensional computational basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$. Suppose we want to find the matrix representation of the operator $A = |0\rangle\langle 1|$.

Here, our basis is $\{|v_1\rangle, |v_2\rangle\} = \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$, and our operator has indices $j=1$ (for state $|0\rangle$) and $k=2$ (for state $|1\rangle$).

According to our result, the matrix should have a '1' in the position (row 1, column 2) and zeros everywhere else.

$$
M_{|0\rangle\langle 1|} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let's verify this by calculating an element, for example, $M_{12}$:
$$M_{12} = \langle 0 | A | 1 \rangle = \langle 0 | (|0\rangle\langle 1|) | 1 \rangle = (\langle 0|0\rangle)(\langle 1|1\rangle) = (1)(1) = 1$$And an element that should be zero, for example, $M_{11}$:$$M_{11} = \langle 0 | A | 0 \rangle = \langle 0 | (|0\rangle\langle 1|) | 0 \rangle = (\langle 0|0\rangle)(\langle 1|0\rangle) = (1)(0) = 0$$
The example confirms our general derivation.
