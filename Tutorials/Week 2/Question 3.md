<!-- 3. Suppose {|vi⟩} is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V . What is the
matrix representation for the operator |vj⟩⟨vk|, with respect to the {|vi⟩} basis? -->

## Solution

The matrix representation of an operator $ A $ in a basis $ \{ |v_i\rangle \} $ is given by $ A_{ij} = \langle v_i | A | v_j \rangle $.

For the operator $ |v_j\rangle \langle v_k | $, we have:
$$
\langle v_i | (|v_j\rangle \langle v_k |) | v_l \rangle = \langle v_i | v_j \rangle \langle v_k | v_l \rangle = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl}
$$

Therefore, the matrix element $ A_{il} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} $.

This means that $ A_{il} = 1 $ when $ i = j $ and $ l = k $, and 0 otherwise.

So, the matrix has a 1 at the position (j, k) (row j, column k), and zeros elsewhere.

In other words, it is the matrix with 1 at row j and column k.
