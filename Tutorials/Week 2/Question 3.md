# 3. Suppose $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space $V$. What is the matrix representation for the operator $|v_j\rangle\langle v_k|$, with respect to the $\{|v_i\rangle\}$ basis?

## Solution

The matrix representation of an operator $A$ in a basis $\{ |v_i\rangle \}$ is given by $A_{ij} = \langle v_i | A | v_j \rangle$.

For the operator $|v_j\rangle \langle v_k |$, we have:

$$
\langle v_i | (|v_j\rangle \langle v_k |) | v_l \rangle = \langle v_i | v_j \rangle \langle v_k | v_l \rangle = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl}
$$

Therefore, the matrix element $A_{il} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl}$.

This means that $A_{il} = 1$ when $i = j$ and $l = k$, and 0 otherwise.

So, the matrix has a 1 at the position (j, k) (row j, column k), and zeros elsewhere.
