Yes, the set of Pauli matrices plus the identity matrix forms an orthonormal basis for this vector space.

To prove that a set of vectors forms an **orthonormal basis**, we must show two things: first, that it is a **basis** (it is linearly independent and spans the space), and second, that it is **orthonormal** with respect to the given inner product. An orthonormal set is one where every vector has a norm of 1 (normality) and is orthogonal to every other vector in the set (orthogonality).

### **Question 12: Show that the set {I, X, Y, Z} is an orthonormal basis for the vector space of 2√ó2 Hermitian matrices with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.**

### **Step 1: The Definition of an Orthonormal Basis**

A set of matrices $\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\} = \{I, X, Y, Z\}$ is an orthonormal basis if it satisfies the condition:

$$\langle A_i, A_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the **Kronecker delta**, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 if $i \neq j$. The inner product we will use is the normalized **Hilbert-Schmidt inner product** for Hermitian matrices:

$$\langle A, B \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(AB)$$

We need to verify two properties:
1.  **Orthogonality**: $\langle A_i, A_j \rangle = 0$ for all $i \neq j$.
2.  **Normality**: $\langle A_i, A_i \rangle = 1$ for all $i$.

We will use two key properties of the Pauli matrices ($\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$ for $X, Y, Z$):
* They are **traceless**: $\text{Tr}(\sigma_i) = 0$.
* They **square to the identity**: $\sigma_i^2 = I$.

### **Step 2: Proving Orthogonality**

We must show that the inner product of any two distinct matrices from the set is zero.

**1. Orthogonality with the Identity Matrix (I)**

Let's compute the inner product of $I$ with any Pauli matrix $\sigma_i$:

$$\langle I, \sigma_i \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(I \sigma_i) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(\sigma_i)$$

Since all Pauli matrices are traceless, $\text{Tr}(\sigma_i) = 0$.

$$\langle I, X \rangle = \langle I, Y \rangle = \langle I, Z \rangle = 0$$

This shows that $I$ is orthogonal to $X, Y,$ and $Z$.

**2. Orthogonality Between Pauli Matrices**

Let's compute the inner product between two distinct Pauli matrices, $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$ where $i \neq j$. A key identity is that for $i \neq j$, $\sigma_i\sigma_j = i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$, where $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol. For example, $XY=iZ$.

$$\langle X, Y \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(XY) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(iZ) = \frac{i}{2}\text{Tr}(Z)$$

Since $\text{Tr}(Z)=0$, we have $\langle X, Y \rangle = 0$. The same logic applies to all other distinct pairs:
* $\langle X, Z \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(XZ) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(-iY) = 0$
* $\langle Y, Z \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(YZ) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(iX) = 0$

Thus, all matrices in the set are mutually orthogonal. ‚úÖ

### **Step 3: Proving Normality**

We must show that the inner product of each matrix with itself is 1.

**1. Norm of the Identity Matrix (I)**

$$\langle I, I \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(I \cdot I) = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(I)$$

The trace of the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix is $\text{Tr}(I) = 1+1=2$.

$$\langle I, I \rangle = \frac{1}{2}(2) = 1$$

**2. Norm of the Pauli Matrices**

Let's compute the norm for any Pauli matrix $\sigma_i$:

$$\langle \sigma_i, \sigma_i \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(\sigma_i^2)$$

Since all Pauli matrices square to the identity, $\sigma_i^2 = I$.

$$\langle \sigma_i, \sigma_i \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(I) = \frac{1}{2}(2) = 1$$

This shows that $\langle X, X \rangle = 1$, $\langle Y, Y \rangle = 1$, and $\langle Z, Z \rangle = 1$. Thus, all matrices in the set are normalized. ‚úÖ

### **Conclusion**

We have shown that for the set $\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\} = \{I, X, Y, Z\}$, the inner product satisfies $\langle A_i, A_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$. This proves that the set is **orthonormal**.

An orthonormal set is always **linearly independent**. The vector space of $2 \times 2$ Hermitian matrices is **4-dimensional**. Since we have a set of 4 linearly independent vectors in a 4-dimensional space, the set also **spans the space** and is therefore a **basis**.

Because the set is both a basis and orthonormal, it is an **orthonormal basis** for the vector space of $2 \times 2$ Hermitian matrices. üèõÔ∏è
