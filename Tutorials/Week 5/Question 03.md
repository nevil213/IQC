The question appears to be incomplete. Based on the setup, the most common and fundamental question is to determine the final state of the circuit when the input is the initial basis state $|00\rangle$. We will proceed by answering this inferred question.

### **Question 3: Circuit reasoning: Consider a two-qubit circuit where the first qubit undergoes a Hadamard gate, followed by a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target. What is the final state if the initial state is $|00\rangle$?**

This circuit is one of the most important in quantum computing, as it is used to generate entanglement.

### **Solution 1: Step-by-Step State Evolution**

This method follows the state of the qubits through the circuit one gate at a time.

**1. Initial State**
The system starts in the state $|\psi_0\rangle$:

$$|\psi_0\rangle = |00\rangle$$

**2. Apply the Hadamard Gate**
A **Hadamard gate (H)** is applied to the first qubit, while the second qubit is unchanged (equivalent to applying the Identity gate, I). The operation is $H \otimes I$.

* The Hadamard gate transforms the first qubit: $H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$.
* The second qubit remains $|0\rangle$.

The state after the Hadamard gate, $|\psi_1\rangle$, is:
$$|\psi_1\rangle = (H|0\rangle) \otimes |0\rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) \otimes |0\rangle$$Distributing the tensor product, we get:$$|\psi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle + |1\rangle \otimes |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |10\rangle)$$

**3. Apply the CNOT Gate**
The **CNOT gate** is applied with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target. We apply it to the state $|\psi_1\rangle$. Due to linearity, we can apply the CNOT to each term in the superposition separately.

$$|\psi_2\rangle = \text{CNOT}(|\psi_1\rangle) = \text{CNOT}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |10\rangle)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\text{CNOT}|00\rangle + \text{CNOT}|10\rangle)$$

* For the $|00\rangle$ term, the control qubit (first) is 0, so the target is unchanged: $\text{CNOT}|00\rangle = |00\rangle$.
* For the $|10\rangle$ term, the control qubit is 1, so the target is flipped ($|0\rangle \rightarrow |1\rangle$): $\text{CNOT}|10\rangle = |11\rangle$.

Substituting these back, we get the final state:

$$|\psi_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

This resulting state is a maximally entangled state known as a **Bell state**, specifically the $|\Phi^+\rangle$ state.

### **Solution 2: The Overall Unitary Matrix Method**

This method involves calculating the single unitary matrix for the entire circuit and applying it to the initial state vector.

**1. Find the Circuit's Unitary Matrix (U)**
The circuit's operation is the CNOT gate applied *after* the Hadamard on the first qubit. So, $U = U_{CNOT} (H \otimes I)$.

* First, we find the matrix for $H \otimes I$:
    $$
    H \otimes I = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
    $$
* The CNOT matrix is:
    $$
    U_{CNOT} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    $$
* Now, we multiply them to get the total unitary $U$:
    $$
    U = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    $$

**2. Apply the Unitary to the Initial State**
The initial state $|00\rangle$ in vector form is:
$$|\psi_0\rangle = |00\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

Now we apply the circuit's matrix $U$ to this vector:
$$|\psi_f\rangle = U |\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**3. Convert the Result Back to Ket Notation**
The resulting vector corresponds to the state:
$$|\psi_f\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 \cdot |00\rangle + 0 \cdot |01\rangle + 0 \cdot |10\rangle + 1 \cdot |11\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

Both methods yield the same final state, the entangled **Bell state** $|\Phi^+\rangle$. âœ¨
